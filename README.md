## Task Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for the Servo Motor Sweep & Hold task, completed as part of the Smart Methods Robotics Training Program (July 2026).
The objective of this task is to achieve synchronized control over four servo motors to perform a single-pass sweep movement from 0 to 180 degrees upon startup, followed by a precise hold at the 90-degree center position, focusing heavily on pulse-width modulation configuration and mechanical calibration to ensure uniform movement.

## Technical Specifications
- **Hardware:** 4x Servo Motors, Arduino Uno R3, Breadboard, and jumper wires.
- **Library:** `<Servo.h>`
- **Calibration:** Angle 102 was selected as the exact mechanical center after practical experimentation and testing.

## Code Logic
The setup phase initializes pins 3, 5, 6, and 9 with an extended pulse range of 200 to 2500 microseconds. This is followed by a sweep action using a for loop ranging from 0 to 180 degrees to ensure a smooth range of motion, and concludes with a fixed write command to angle 102 to lock the servos in place without further iteration.

## Simulation Demo
This project was fully designed, coded, and validated using the Tinkercad simulation environment.
